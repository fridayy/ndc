# ndc

_ndc_ is a simple command line utility tool to provide an overview of out-dated node dependencies and its best use is
probably in CI environments before or after the build step of a node project.

> If you are planning to have code in multiple files (which is quite natural for a NodeJS module) that users can import, make sure you update `src/index.ts` file appropriately.

Now assuming you have published this amazing module to _npm_ with the name `my-amazing-lib`, and installed it in the module in which you need it -

- To use the `Greeter` class in a TypeScript file -

```ts
import { Greeter } from "my-amazing-lib";

const greeter = new Greeter("World!");
greeter.greet();
```

- To use the `Greeter` class in a JavaScript file -

```js
const Greeter = require('my-amazing-lib').Greeter;

const greeter = new Greeter('World!');
greeter.greet();
```
